# Core-ConsoleApp
 .NET Core has brought a lot of great benefits right into the .NET language. We get dependency injection, a much better configuration system, and we get a common logging system that is easy to use. The only problem is that mainly, we only get these things set up for us in web environments. What happens when we want to get these things running in a Console app? Well, it takes a bit of extra work, but it can be done. In this video, we are going to set up dependency injection, configuration using appsettings.json, and logging using Serilog in a Console application.
